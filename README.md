## 🚀 Abstract
Welcome to the Hangman project, part of the AICore training module. This code aims to take a guess for a character from a user and compare it to a randomly chosen fruit. If the character if found within the randomly chosen fruit name then the user is sucessfull, if not they are invited to try again

## 📚 Install

## 📝 Usage
Once intialised the code can be run via the terminal and the user is able to make guesses.

The program will ask for the user to select a letter.

Once selected the program will assess the guess to ensure it is a valid letter, and whether it is in the chosen word.

Once determined it will reduce the number of valid letters remaining or reduce the users life count by 1.
